This code was built by copying the code of user @rriver, simply because I liked her organization and use of cool details and emojis, as well as the cool title screen. 
However, the code was done with HTML, and I am supposed to learn Markdown. Thus, there is a combination of Markdown and HTML.
If it looks like I don't know what I am doing, you are correct.

<h1>ðŸ’» PROJECTS</h1>

As stated above I am just getting started learning to code. 
Aside from the short projects that get assigned by Codecademy.com, I don't have any projects of my own (yet).

With **Codecademy** I have taken the course to learn Python 3, and I am currently working through the iOS Career Path which includes learning Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode and learning how to use and participate in GitHub.

I am also helping my company by working on software development that runs on C. The eventual goal is to design apps that will
pair with cool products that the company I work for is in the process of making.

My background is in graphic design. I enjoy all things design related, as well as story telling. 
Sometimes I write short stories that I might soon also share here.

Feel free to reach out.
Cheers!</br>
